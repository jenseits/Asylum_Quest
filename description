Asylum Quest is a game about the fight that people battling depression have to take on every day. It is the continuity, in a way, 
of Zoe Quinn's acclaimed Depression Quest from Valentine's Day 2013 (solitude is depression in its empirical form).

Asylum quest is absolutely not funny at all.

Not.

Fucking.

Funny.

In this game, you are still a loser, a mid-twenties human, and you still have a significant other with a genderless name so that you can identify better with the character. 
Call him/her Alex like in DP, or otherwise browse this site : http://www.babynames1000.com/gender-neutral/ 

My personal favorite is Justice, it makes me feel even more depressed when I play.

You live in Paris, France, the most beautiful city in the world, with the greatest assholes living there.

You shouldn't really enjoy this game. Depression is a very serious and you must seek help, there are plenty of very effective drugs out there.
